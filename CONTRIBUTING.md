## Contributing to the MongoDB .NET Analyzer

### Bugfixes

- Before starting to write code, look for existing [tickets](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/VS#selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.project%3Asummary-panel) or create one for your specific issue. That way you avoid working on something that might not be of interest or that has been addressed already in a different branch.
- Fork the [repo](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-csharp-analyzer).
- Ensure your core.autocrlf settings are set to true.
- Follow the general coding style of the rest of the project.
- Write tests and make sure they pass.
- Your final commit should have the JIRA issue number as the first part of the commit message.
- Submit a pull request from GitHub.
